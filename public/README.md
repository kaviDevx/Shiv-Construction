# Public Assets Folder

## Logo Setup Instructions

1. **Add your logo file:**
   - Place your logo image file in this `public` folder
   - Name it: `logo.png` (or `logo.jpg` if it's a JPG)
   - Recommended size: 512x512px or larger for best quality
   - The logo should have a transparent background or match your site's design

2. **Favicon:**
   - For favicon, you can either:
     - Use the same `logo.png` file (it will be automatically used)
     - Or create a separate `favicon.ico` file (16x16 or 32x32px) and place it here

3. **File formats supported:**
   - PNG (recommended for logos with transparency)
   - JPG/JPEG
   - SVG (scalable, best for logos)
   - ICO (for favicon)

## Current Setup

The website is configured to use:
- `/logo.png` as the main logo (used in Navbar and Footer)
- `/favicon.ico` as the browser favicon (optional, falls back to logo.png)

After adding your logo file, restart the development server to see the changes.
